6:50 PM - 29 Nov 2015|That last AMBER Alert was obviously an older boyfriend scenario. Still, if you love a woman when she's 17, you can wait until 18.
6:43 PM - 29 Nov 2015|Thank you, rangers, for retweeting these AMBER Alerts. We might help save someone's life.
10:09 PM - 27 Nov 2015|After looking at Papa John's it seems you can order a vegan pizza with regular crust, no cheese, and veggies. Way to go, @PapaJohns
9:56 PM - 27 Nov 2015|I respect everyone's dietary decisions but this ranger needs dairy, poultry, and seafood. No mammal meat.

9:02 AM - 22 Nov 2015|If you haven't already,  all SciTech Rangers should follow @verge. I frequently share their links.
8:20 AM - 22 Nov 2015|If I skydive I don't lose my 180 lbs of weight. It just feels like that until I open my parachute.
8:19 AM - 22 Nov 2015|Ranger @theschlem and I had a nice little chat about weightlessness in space. We are both right.
7:31 AM - 22 Nov 2015|Want to get rich? Design and patent a bendable DVD/Blu-ray. The new Floppy Disc would mean no more broken Netflix rentals!

9:26 PM - 5 Nov 2015|Back to the fictitious ABC, LLC, how about, You create, we show the world
9:24 PM - 5 Nov 2015|PR and advertising is not my forte but I can recognize a good straightforward campaign like Arby's We have the meats!
9:18 PM - 5 Nov 2015|Fictitious Example: ABC, LLC is passionate about accentuating creative thought to create harmony in your business's thought paradigm. Huh?
9:14 PM - 5 Nov 2015|When I see a company use vacuous words in its Twitter profile I pause on following. Tell me what you actually do then maybe I'll follow back
8:40 AM - 3 Nov 2015|Twitter is trying to make me love things with this stupid new heart but I don't have a soul. Please put it back to giving one star reviews.
4:52 PM - 31 Oct 2015|If you bought one of those Child's Play bags of candy for Halloween, beware. I opened a Tootsie Roll and there was nothing but cardboard.

1:45 PM - 22 Oct 2015|BTW, you rangers ARE backing up your critical files, right?
1:44 PM - 22 Oct 2015|If my business life revolved around a laptop, I would need an immediate replacement. You can't get that with extended warranties.
1:37 PM - 22 Oct 2015|*crickets*
1:27 PM - 22 Oct 2015|Do any of you rangers have something to say about extended warranties?
1:22 PM - 22 Oct 2015|Anything electronic can fail so use your own judgement on extended warranties. It's probably money wasted, like any insurance, but what if?
1:18 PM - 22 Oct 2015|Extended warranties can be iffy. I wouldn't buy one on a TV but if I were not a computer geek I might buy one on a new laptop.
1:09 PM - 22 Oct 2015|Something I see salespeople struggle over is very basic, ask for the sale. Got an extended warranty? Offer it, don't push it.
10:39 AM - 22 Oct 2015|Ranger @GustavoEBarriga just reminded me that I want 'Amazing Grace' played on bagpipes at my funeral. Ave Maria would be nice too.
5:40 AM - 22 Oct 2015|Thank you for retweeting AMBER Alerts. You rangers are the best.

4:07 PM - 21 Oct 2015|I'm not getting paid for this but if you spend a lot of time in front of a computer monitor, get some Gunnar glasses. All for now.
3:43 PM - 21 Oct 2015|I've had six dogs in my life and didn't own any of them. They were adopted into the family.
3:38 PM - 21 Oct 2015|Humans are a strange species. Every time we see something cute we want to put it in a cage or a jar.
3:07 PM - 21 Oct 2015|This is either an early or belated #FF: @SiDawson. He created a great Twitter tool and taught me some of the ropes way back when.
2:40 PM - 21 Oct 2015|The closest I've ever gotten to a Back to the Future II hoverboard was an ASUS motherboard.
7:38 AM - 21 Oct 2015|Happy Birthday, @carrieffisher. Call me.
5:30 PM - 20 Oct 2015|I was chatting with ranger @Carlos_RSL about how Marvel and DC both have trademarks on the terms super hero and superhero.
5:28 PM - 20 Oct 2015|Marvel really should take the high road here.
5:18 PM - 20 Oct 2015|I really wish Marvel would shut up and let SHAZAM be called by his true name, Captain Marvel.
4:24 PM - 20 Oct 2015|I just had an epiphany! When you see a TV show has been rated TV-14 LV that does not mean it was shot in Las Vegas!
4:07 PM - 20 Oct 2015|Some people put rude answers in the Location part of their profiles. Twitter already knows where you are. That's for potential followers.
12:37 PM - 19 Oct 2015|Sure, these little 'made in China' toys look cute. At night, these mad robots are stealing your Wi-Fi and deleting your MP3 collections!
12:35 PM - 19 Oct 2015|When I am elected president, I will also strengthen our borders against mad robots!
12:32 PM - 19 Oct 2015|I am announcing my run to become president of the USA. I promise a flying car in every garage!
10:23 AM - 19 Oct 2015|I will still rate my self-built PC's on how many gigglespurtz they have.
10:21 AM - 19 Oct 2015|From now on, in my non-published SF novels, I will use the term trilobyte. It means nothing but sounds huge even to tomorrow's generation.
10:08 AM - 19 Oct 2015|What? My assistant just informed me they have terrorbite thingies now.
10:04 AM - 19 Oct 2015|After 8 years of faithful service, my Western Digital hard drive is giving death sounds. Time to upgrade to a gigagiggle thingie.
9:54 PM - 18 Oct 2015|Bringing what you know to a company is, at best, a third of the equation. What you are willing to learn is the rest.
9:38 PM - 18 Oct 2015|@SciTechRangers what i want in a resume: Clear work history, dates need to match, explain gaps, clear education background, tech mastery
9:28 PM - 18 Oct 2015|One of my bosses and I got an application. The reason for separation from his previous job was being accidentally fired.
9:25 PM - 18 Oct 2015|@SciTechRangers hilarious. saw one with studying for my 5th degree last week.
9:22 PM - 18 Oct 2015|Again, this is just me. Just tell me what you can do for me and leave your 'passions' out. I don't even care what your hobbies are.
9:19 PM - 18 Oct 2015|Bad Resume: I am passionate about combining thought and effort into a team of progress.  So, what the heck can you do, again?
9:12 PM - 18 Oct 2015|I don't know about other managers but when I see passionate on a resume it goes to the bottom of the pile.
11:46 AM - 16 Oct 2015|I hope Betty at @ChickenTreat doesn't try to send me a DM. I don't read those.
11:18 PM - 8 Oct 2015|I'm getting sleepy. It's 12:17 AM here on Mormon time. That means I'll be on @Shadowbat for a while. Nighty nighty.
11:13 PM - 8 Oct 2015|If @Dell switches to American manufacturing and tech support, they will have to charge more. I love their XPS line.
11:07 PM - 8 Oct 2015|@SciTechRangers @Dell I think we'd like American tech support.
11:05 PM - 8 Oct 2015|@SciTechRangers Yeah most people are when taking to techs. Writing a Howto for when talking to tech support for a podcast
11:09 PM - 8 Oct 2015|What do you rangers think? Should @Dell bring it back home?
11:01 PM - 8 Oct 2015|Thank you, rangers, for keeping an old tech entertained. And thank you @ActuallyNPH for being one of my favorite anecdotes.
10:42 PM - 8 Oct 2015|I'm still upset at Gerard Depardieu. Between his crappy English and my crappy French we didn't need his assistants. Thought I made a friend
10:35 PM - 8 Oct 2015|Self-built is awesome but I'm lazy. I'd rather buy a computer and upgrade it as time goes on.
10:29 PM - 8 Oct 2015|Rangers, would you pay an extra $100 for a locally made PC? Reaching out to the American, Canadian, and European rangers here.
10:25 PM - 8 Oct 2015|Okay, off the soapbox. For now.
10:25 PM - 8 Oct 2015|And to Gerard Depardieu, I sold you an American computer and now you talk shit about the US?
10:22 PM - 8 Oct 2015|One thing I would say to Dell, become a quality brand and bring all the work back to the US.
10:17 PM - 8 Oct 2015|Everyone has complaints about every brand. I still like Dell products and I'm no longer paid to say that.
10:11 PM - 8 Oct 2015|Neil Patrick Harris once bitched at me when I worked Dell tech support. I felt compelled to share that.
3:42 PM - 8 Oct 2015|That feeling when you realize you are blocked by someone you don't know.
12:02 PM - 7 Oct 2015|If you rangers aren't following @TheMikiShow then you are missing out.
11:55 AM - 7 Oct 2015|I have another tweet scheduled in a few minutes. If you rangers have anything newsworthy, please share.
11:31 AM - 7 Oct 2015|I remember when broadband was totally cool! I also remember selling home computers after teaching people how to print their names in BASIC
4:42 PM - 6 Oct 2015|I didn't tweet much today but join us tomorrow! Same SciTech time, same SciTech channel!
4:38 PM - 6 Oct 2015|One thing about talking to bears, don't start off with, Hey, Boo Boo!
4:35 PM - 6 Oct 2015|Bears? I think I would crap my spacesuit but I'd give a try at friendship.
4:33 PM - 6 Oct 2015|Canines, pshhh. They know I'm one of the pack. Felines...lets just say we respect each other.
4:31 PM - 6 Oct 2015|I am a bit of an animal whisperer. I would probably make peace with a bear or die trying.
4:24 PM - 6 Oct 2015|Seriously, don't rely your life on pepper spray. It only made me angry. Not at my nephew, just at his mother, lol.
4:21 PM - 6 Oct 2015|Oh yeah, I'm also @Shadowbat. That's the Twitter profile I hope future prospective employers won't look at.
4:18 PM - 6 Oct 2015|Trust me. If you encounter an angry bear make peace with it or play dead.
4:17 PM - 6 Oct 2015|My nephew got hold of his mom's pepper spray. Look, uncle Shadowbat!
4:14 PM - 6 Oct 2015|If you are tempted to pepper spray a bear, don't. I was once accidentally pepper sprayed. I could have mauled someone.
4:03 PM - 6 Oct 2015|It seems @Comcast has some pretty good techs. Good on ya!
4:03 PM - 6 Oct 2015|Ended up I needed a @Comcast tech here at the SciTechRangers satellite. Randy Swenson was a gentleman and a fellow swede!
4:02 PM - 5 Oct 2015|Gotta give a shout out to @TheMikiShow. She and I have debated about Elizabethan English which is not a pure science. I love her show.
2:20 PM - 5 Oct 2015|@SciTechRangers @comcast Comcast is probably the most infuriating company I've ever dealt with that wasn't armed
2:06 PM - 5 Oct 2015|I used to vet out friendship requests on Facebook but I really have nothing to hide. I'm just this tech guy, nothing more.
1:58 PM - 5 Oct 2015|I wish @Comcast would just let me  swap out cable boxes. Everything was okay until I installed the Demon Machine.
1:53 PM - 5 Oct 2015|I'm pretty sure it is a faulty HD cable box but we will see.
1:50 PM - 5 Oct 2015|The Rangers Internet is still a bit wonky at times so we will cross our fingers.
1:48 PM - 5 Oct 2015|I might have prematurely said my Comcast worries were over. I have a tech coming over tomorrow.

3:35 PM - 29 Sep 2015|AMBER Alert for Lucios Mitchell has been canceled.

11:16 AM - 26 Sep 2015|I feel like a cosmetics test animal. I have involuntarily sat behind diesel engines at stoplights. No, the animals have it worse.
11:05 AM - 26 Sep 2015|Thank you, rangers. I've had the blues lately but you always cheer me up.
11:03 AM - 26 Sep 2015|@SciTechRangers now I'm afraid if I say Dieselbus three times in row, they will all appear and chase me
10:59 AM - 26 Sep 2015|.@RobWhitemore1 Get it? Light? As in fumes waiting for a stoplight? Okay, I'll shut up now.
10:55 AM - 26 Sep 2015|Okay, they weren't actually asthma attacks. I haven't suffered from that since I was a child but I can't stand driving behind a diesel.
10:51 AM - 26 Sep 2015|So now we have #dieselgate? I could have told you diesel was toxic from my asthma attacks.
10:32 AM - 26 Sep 2015|I just saw a Twitter profile describe  Earth as the third planet in the universe. Read a book!

3:45 PM - 23 Sep 2015|OK, one more #TruthOrBaloney from me then someone needs to take up the torch. I was the lead singer of a heavy metal band, Aries Rising.
3:41 PM - 23 Sep 2015|Thank you, ranger @Lholland78 for playing #TruthOrBaloney but you are dead wrong. I really do cry when I hear Ave Maria.
3:34 PM - 23 Sep 2015|Fine. You don't want to play #TruthOrBaloney. I'm taking my sandwich and going home.
3:26 PM - 23 Sep 2015|Gee, this game is taking a while to catch on #TruthOrBaloney
3:20 PM - 23 Sep 2015|#TruthorBaloney I cry every time I hear Ave Maria. Is that truth? Or is it baloney?
3:19 PM - 23 Sep 2015|I have a new game for you rangers. It's called Truth or Baloney I'll start...
