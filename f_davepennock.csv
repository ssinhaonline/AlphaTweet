4:31 PM - 4 Mar 2014|Uninspired basketball by the #Cuse tonight.
9:26 AM - 3 Mar 2014|By the way, tomorrow night's Syracuse-Georgia Tech game will be on MSG+ 2. That's channel 353 on Time Warner, 82 on FIOS. So, good luck.
8:38 AM - 1 Mar 2014|So, the Syverud who went to Georgetown is rooting for Syracuse while the one who went to Syracuse is rooting for Virginia. #Syverudism
8:33 AM - 1 Mar 2014|#BeatVirginia that is all.
7:19 AM - 1 Mar 2014|Looking forward to having @SyracuseU Chancellor Syverud on our pregame show. #MustBeABigGame #SUvoice #OrangeNation pic.twitter.com/w74QaT77eJ
6:12 PM - 27 Feb 2014|Penn State's jerseys tonight look like the old Georgetown ones. #georgetownstillsucks
5:33 PM - 25 Feb 2014|Beautiful tribute to Harold Ramis by @Headkutter. What do you guys think? If you like it, retweet it! #RIPHaroldRamis pic.twitter.com/9bPGQmf0F3
4:06 PM - 25 Feb 2014|Excellent day at Syracuse, sitting down with Coach Jim Boeheim. @Cuse pic.twitter.com/l71RsHMbCp
2:54 PM - 25 Feb 2014|@ACUI100 @PorterButtsUW The only way Porter is bringing friends is with a ouija board.
6:04 PM - 24 Feb 2014|Pepto, defibrillator, stress ball and breakable furniture. The SU hoops checklist for the rest of the year.
4:33 PM - 24 Feb 2014|That was the same play as the end of the Duke game lol. No call tonight #BoeheimEffect
9:18 AM - 23 Feb 2014|North Carolina fan told me yesterday before the game: You can't go to Cameron and put the game in the officials hands. Spot on.
6:40 PM - 22 Feb 2014|Please tell me there's a side-by-side of the Parker block call next to the C.J. charge.
6:21 PM - 22 Feb 2014|When even Douchebag of the century Doug Gottlieb says it wasn't a foul. That says something
6:00 PM - 22 Feb 2014|More Duke bullshit.  Unreal.
4:52 PM - 22 Feb 2014|Officials are letting Duke defenders put their hands all over the SU players. #callthefoul
4:43 PM - 22 Feb 2014|Cooney should drive to the basket to get himself going.
7:06 AM - 22 Feb 2014|#BeatDuke.  That is all.
7:44 PM - 20 Feb 2014|Duke is clearly the better team. They are letting UNC hang around and that could cost them.
6:18 PM - 19 Feb 2014|#Cuse deserved to lose. Terrible effort against a terrible team.
6:19 PM - 15 Feb 2014|And Cuse again huh...putting people in hospitals all year long. Wow.
4:12 AM - 14 Feb 2014|So apparently the #syracuse city plows are all on vacation in Florida today.  Be careful out there - city roads are beyond awful.
7:26 PM - 12 Feb 2014|Did everyone see Ennis just miss a half court shot at the end of the first half?  He was just warming up!  #Cuse
6:32 PM - 12 Feb 2014|No doubt my #Cuse is legit the best team in the land. Great job on the comeback! #wearenumberone
6:09 PM - 12 Feb 2014|That was the kind of foul Christmas needed not to make.
5:47 PM - 12 Feb 2014|I get you aren't going to get as many calls on the road, but they have missed too many OBVIOUS calls.
5:46 PM - 12 Feb 2014|Can we get some foul calls against Pitt?  Just curious.
5:39 PM - 12 Feb 2014|That was a charge Doris. Not even close.
4:28 PM - 12 Feb 2014|Rebounds for the #Cuse please. Thanks.
6:23 PM - 8 Feb 2014|Great game between Wichita St and N. Iowa on ESPN2. Check it out!
5:36 PM - 3 Feb 2014|Nobody will get his name wrong now!  #TrevorCooney
